## Installation

Be aware: Sirius UI is still in alpha development!

### NPM

```sh
npm install sirius-ui
```

### or download the [Latest Release](https://github.com/macmotp/sirius/archive/master.zip)

## Basic Usage

You can copy and inject the latest release directly into your HTML:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Sirius UI - CSS Framework based on flexbox and Vuejs - powered by Larastars</title>
        <link href="/dist/css/sirius.min.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- your code here -->
        <script src="/dist/js/sirius.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```
## Advanced Usage and Laravel Integration

Sirius uses the wonderful [Laravel Mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix) to built its assets. If you want to change SASS variables or add your own Vue components, install node dependencies:

```sh
# browse to project
cd sirius-ui
# install dependencies
npm install
```

For [Laravel 5](https://laravel.com) integration, copy the [assets](https://github.com/macmotp/sirius/tree/master/assets) folder into your resources project. If you are familiar with Laravel Mix, you know you can simply run

```sh
# compile assets in development
npm run dev

# compile and minify assets for production
npm run production
```

in order to compile SASS and Vue
